							                In-person trading and payment: The safest and best way to buy is in-person trading. This means that the buyer can see, check, and pay at the same time with the seller. Never postpone payment until after the goods or services have been delivered.
							            </li>
							            <li>
							                Safe Place: For in-person trading, public and crowded places such as bank branches and sheriffs are suitable.
							            </li>
							            <li>
							                Transaction Evidence: It is advisable to obtain a valid written receipt from the seller when purchasing the goods.
							            </li>

							                Cash payment: It is better to pay in cash.
							            </li>
							            <li>
							                Online payment and card-to-card payment: If you pay online or card-to-card, don't pay for the payment receipt. Before delivering the goods, make sure you have the money in your account.
							            </li>
